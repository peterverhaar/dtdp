# Firstly, we create two values a and b
# and give them numerical values

a = 4
b = 3

c = a + b
print(c)
# c now has value 7

c = a * b ;
print(c)
#c now has value 12

c = a - b
print(c)
# c has value 1

c = c+1
print(c)
#c now has value 2

c+= 1
print(c)
#c now has value 3. The syntax used in line 19 is
#a shorthand notation for the statement given on line 16.
